                Living by the way of the board, we want to make snowboarding accessible for all. 
                We try to lower the bar for entry by abolishing the gatekeeping, 
                recommending the best gear and slopes for all levels of riding,
                and by embraces the newbies!
                <br><br>
                We hope, with the help of our website, that you will find the experience of 
                buying your first snowboard and finding the first slope to ride,
                or maybe switching from a freeride to a freestyle snowboard for the first time with years of experience,
                as smooth and easy as possible!
