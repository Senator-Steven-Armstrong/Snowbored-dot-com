                <h2>Personal Pick: <br> Overall Freestyle</h2>
                <p>
                    If youre looking for the perfect, all-around freestyle park snowboard,
                    then this is the pick for you! <br>
                    <br>
                    With a camber profile and soft-medium flex this 
                    puppy performs well on any park obstacle. Beginner friendly, but also useful for the more experienced
                    riders, you can even ride this all-mountain, just don't hit the biggest of jumps
                    with it. It was my first owned snowboard and i recommend the same for you!

                <h2>Best Beginner Park Snowboard</h2>
                <p>
                    New to the park, or just looking for a fun jib-board that still shreds the rest of the mountain?
                    Then this is just the board for you! <br>
                    <br>
                    One of the most popular park snowboards, Camber profile, and medium flex. This is a recipe for a well rounded board.
                    However the thing that sets it apart from other boards is the Bataleon 3bt technology,
                    allowing you to butter without the risk of catching an edge.
