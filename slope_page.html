                <h2>Personal Pick: Vemdalen, Sweden </h2>
                <p>
                    Vemdalen is pretty much the only slope iv'e ridden for
                    the past 17 years, with some minor exceptions. I have the most experience
                    with this slope, which is why it is my personal pick. <br>
                    <br>
                    It isn't the biggest of resorts, but it's honest work.
                    The terrain parks are unfortunately not that good and mostly
                    ridden by little kids, but the rest of the mountain is
                    a blast.

                <h2>Mammoth mountain, USA </h2>
                <p>
                    As a fellow park rider myself, i am of course going
                    to put Mammoth mountain on the list, as it
                    holds the biggest terrain park in the world! <br>
                    <br>
                    The mountain itself it huge, with a lot of variety in it's terrain.
                    What sets it apart is their terrain parks. With over a dozen with
                    unique and different obstacles, it's a dream to ride.
                    It also has other fun things to do such as gondola rides and
                    "woolly's tube park".

                <h2>Väsjöbacken, Sweden </h2>
                <p>
                    I cannot stress enough how absolutley fantastic Väsjöbacken is,
                    and iv'e never even ridden it! <br>
                    
                    It's a huge resort, with an astonishing 3 slopes to choose from,
                    and none of them are steep! Their park is insane, with obstacles
                    not from this earth. Iv'e also heard they've manufactured a
                    gravitational force field around Väsjöbacken that prevents people inside from getting
                    hurt, so you can full send it everytime!
                    It also has a heavenly view of Sollentuna!
